# react-prerender [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Robert-W/react-prerender.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Robert-W/react-prerender)
> Simple node script to prerender react components.  This is designed to be used as a tool in the build process and can run right after Grunt/Gulp or any other build tools you use.

## Still Under Development

### Purpose
Any application rendering their UI from javascript should prerender it's UI because of the improved SEO and UX it offers.  This script can fit right into your build process.  It will prender your React components and inject them into your html.  Even if you have lots of packages and/or aliases, or use modules that are not available locally at build time (CDN, or loaded via script tag), this script can be customized to help you require those components in node and render them to your page.
